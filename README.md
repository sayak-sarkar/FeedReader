FeedReader
==========

A Basic Enyo 1.0 based RSS Feed Reader Web App.

Usage
=====

* Grab the source of GitHub.  

* If you wanna check it out on your computer, you would require Google Chrome, as Enyo 1.0 was primarily Webkit based! Open index.html on Google Chrome with `--allow-file-access-from-files` and `--disable-web-security` flags set.  

* If you wanna take it out for a spin on your mobile device, feel free to write a manfiest for your device's platform with the execution source set to index.html. However, you might also try PhoneGap if you are as lazy as me!
